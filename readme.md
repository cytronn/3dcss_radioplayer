Here's my HTML - CSS - JS radio receiver.

TECH USED :

CSS 3D TRANSFORMS (body of the receiver, 3D buttons)

CHECKBOX HACK (for the ON / OFF switch)

CSS TRANSITIONS ( used during the channel switch)

CSS ANIMATIONS (for the receiver spinning and the boomers scaling)

HTML5 AUDIO (used to livestream the radio channels)

JQUERY (in order to change the audio sources, change the channel selection marker's postion, and manage the spinning/stop spinning button)

FEATURES :

You can turn the radio on and off, change the channels, and make the radio spin. All at once.
