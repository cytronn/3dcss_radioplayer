Here's my HTML - CSS - JS radio receiver.

TECH USED :

CSS 3D TRANSFORMS (body of the receiver, 3D buttons)

CHECKBOX HACK (for the ON / OFF switch)

CSS TRANSITIONS ( used during the channel switch)

CSS ANIMATIONS (for the receiver spinning and the boomers scaling)

HTML5 AUDIO (used to livestream the radio channels)

JQUERY (in order to change the audio sources, change the channel selection marker's postion, and manage the spinning/stop spinning button)

FEATURES :

You can turn the radio on and off, change the channels, and make the radio spin. All at once.


DIFFICULTIES : 


The buttons could have been done better, but I lacked time and messed with the positionning. Though, the circular 3D was well done for the top corner of the receiver, even if I first thought it would be the most difficult thing to do.

I had a hard time managin all the glitches, but things got better once I dispatched some "preserve-3d"
